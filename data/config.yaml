# The default file type for input_config_source is an Excel spreadsheet that contains the configuration for your simulation.
# If you need a new, empty config file, you can generate one by specifying one of the following commands next to input_config_source (remove the quotation marks):
# "generate core shell template" <-- This will make a new template for a core-shell simulation
# "generate dumbbell template" <--- This will make a new template for a dumbbell simulation using a semi-analytical approximate form-factor
# "generate numerical dumbbell template" <--- This will make a new template for a dumbbell simulation using a fully numerical form-factor
# "generate reload template" <--- This will make a template that will allow you to reload a previously completed simulation

output_folder : ./results

# This is the folder where you will find your output and log files after the simulation is over.
